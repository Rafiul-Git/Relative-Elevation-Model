Relative Elevation Model (REM) – Overview

A Relative Elevation Model (REM) is a terrain representation derived from a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) that expresses elevation values relative to a defined reference surface, rather than absolute height above sea level. Unlike conventional DEMs, which represent absolute topography, REMs emphasize local elevation differences, making them particularly effective for analyzing landscape position and terrain variability.

The reference surface used in REM generation is commonly based on hydrological features such as river channels, valley bottoms, or locally minimum elevations. By subtracting this reference surface from the original DEM, the REM highlights subtle topographic variations that may be obscured in absolute elevation data.

REMs are widely applied in geomorphology, hydrology, floodplain mapping, and environmental modeling, where relative height above drainage networks is often more meaningful than absolute elevation. They are especially useful in low-relief landscapes, flood-prone regions, and alluvial environments, where small elevation differences can have significant hydrological and ecological implications.

The work was inspired by the learning resources from Milos Makes Mapes and HyRiver. I sincerely acknowledge their tutorials and shared methods which helped shape the approach used in this project.
